    1. Adding spendings and sources of income
    2. Ability for user to add their own categories
    3. Ability to edit existing categories and spendings
    4. Sorting and filtering categories and spendings

    2. Budget calculation
    3. Charts of spendings and incomes
    4. Simple app settings (ability to change the colour theme of the app, charts options)
